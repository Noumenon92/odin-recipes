            <li>two large onions, sliced</li>
            <li>20mg butter</li>
        
        </ul>

        </ul>
    
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the filling, rinse the sauerkraut in a sieve, under plenty of running water. Drain well. Heat 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil in a large frying pan and add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, over a medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for a further 5 minutes. Now add the drained sauerkraut and cook for a further 10 minutes, until soft. There should be no liquid in the pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To make the dough, measure the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the centre.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Crack the egg into the well with the hot water, salt and oil. Quickly beat the wet ingredients with a fork then slowly incorporate the flour, until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Knead for about 8 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding a little extra flour if it sticks. Divide the dough into thirds and keep covered</li>
        <br>
        <li>Roll the first third out on a lightly floured surface, until it is an even 3mm thick. Using a plain, round 7cm cutter, stamp out about 12 circles. Keep the finished circles covered with a slightly damp tea towel to prevent them drying out. Repeat with the remaining two lots of dough to make about 36 circles.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To fill, cup a circle in your palm, and put a packed teaspoonful of filling in the middle.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Lightly wet the edges with water and pinch together tightly to seal. You can crimp with a fork if you wish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Keep the surface dusted with flour and cover the finished dumplings with a tea towel to prevent them drying out.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To make the topping, soften the onions in the butter, with a pinch of salt, for 15 minutes, until soft and golden. Turn up the heat and cook for a few minutes more, until caramelised</li>
        <br>
        <li>To cook the pierogies, bring a large saucepanful of lightly salted water to the boil. Add half the pierogi and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring now and then to prevent sticking. Drain with a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate and simmer the remaining pierogies.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve the pierogies as is, with the onion topping spooned over, or heat the remaining oil and the butter in a large frying pan and brown the pierogies on both sides, in batches. Spoon the onions over to serve.</li>
    </ol>
